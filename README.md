# AI-as-a-Systemic-Factor-in-Portfolio-Risk
This project models AI-driven systemic risk across equity portfolios using real market cap data. It computes company-level AI exposure, calculates portfolio-level weighted AI risk, and visualizes stress scenarios and correlation spikes to show how diversification can fail during an AI shock.

### Features
- Fetches real-time market cap data from Yahoo Finance
- Calculates company and sector-level AI exposure
- Models portfolio impact under AI shock scenarios
- Visualizes risk contributions and correlation regime shifts

It’s a factor-based risk analysis, demonstrating how underlying technology dependencies impact cross-sector portfolio stability.
